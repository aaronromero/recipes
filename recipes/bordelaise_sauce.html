    <h1>Bordelaise Sauce</h1>
    <p>A famous sauce of Bordeaux that goes great with any beef dish.</p>
    <p><strong>Serving Size:</strong> 4</p>
    <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 60 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound inexpensive stew meat or beef shank meat, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>0.24 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>6 shallots, sliced (about 0.5 cup)</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic, halved horizontally</li>
        <li>1 bouquet garni (bundle of 6-8 sprigs of parsley, 3 sprigs of thyme, and a bay leaf)</li>
        <li>3 cups dry red wine (preferrably a bordeaux)</li>
        <li>3 cups Veal Stock</li>
        <!-- Add more ingredients as necessary -->
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the beef cubes with the salt and pepper. In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the oil over a medium-high flame. When it begins to smoke, add the meat (work in batches if necessary) and brown well on all sides, 3-5 minutes per side. When all the beef is well browned, add teh shallots and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the shallots brown.</li>
        <li>Add the head of garlic and the bouquet garni, and follow with the red wine. Raise the flame to high to bring to a boil and use a wooden spoon to free any caramelized bits from the pan. When the liquid has reduced by three quarters, about 12 to 15 minutes, and what remains is chick and dark, and the veal stock. Bring to a boil, and use a spoon or lable to skim the surface of any fat or impurities taht accumulate. Lower the flame to medium and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes, until the sauce is thick and brown, with an appetizing consistency (it will coat the back of a wooden spoon). Strain and discard solids.</li>
        <li>Store covered in the refrigerator for 1 week, or freeze.</li>
