    <h1>Pasta Alla Genovese</h1>
    <p>Here a rather simple version of pasta alla Genovese, one of the most loved Neapolitan pasta dishes, but, curiously, one that is pretty much unknown outside of Naples. Although the sauce, like any proper Neapolitan ragu, takes hours to cook, the preparation is otherwise incredibly easy.</p>
    <p><strong>Serving Size:</strong> 4</p>
    <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 40 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 5 hours</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 lbs beef for braising (best to use a mix of different cuts)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>5 lbs yellow or white onions, sliced thin</li>
        <li>14 oz ziti spezzati or rigatoni</li>
        <li>2 oz percorino cheese</li>
        <!-- Add more ingredients as necessary -->
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Leave one piece of beef as is and cut the reset of it into chunks.</li>
        <li>Place some of the olive oil in a large saucepan and warm it over medium-high heat. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, add the beef and sear until it is browned all over, turning it as necessary.</li>
        <li>Place all of the beef in the pan and cover it with the onions. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and cook, stirring occassionally, until the onions start to soften.</li>
        <li>Uncover the pan and cook until the meat is tender but not yet falling apart, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Season the mixture with salt, remove the biggest piece of beef from the saucepan, and set it aside. Cover the pan and continue cooking the sauce until the onions have almost dissolved and the sauce becomes juicy, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add salt, let the water return to a full boil, and add the pasta. Cook until the pasta is al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, place it in a serving dish, and add some of the sauce and half of the pecorino. Toss to combine and top with the remaining pecorino.</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining sauce over the large piece of beef and serve it following the pasta dish.</li>
