    <h1>Egg Pasta</h1>
    <p>This is a go to pasta recipe that works well for any pasta dish!</p>
    <p><strong>Serving Size:</strong> 4</p>
    <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 45 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>300 grams 00 flour</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Diamond Crystal Kosher salt</li>
        <!-- Add more ingredients as necessary -->
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a small mixing bowl on a kitchen scale and zero out. Add 2 large eggs. Then add 3 large yolks. Then add enough water to get to 185 grams.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt to the bowl. Diamond Crystal Kosher salt is recommended. DO NOT use Mortons kosher salt; it does not dissolve well. Using a fork, mix the eggs well and set aside.</li>
        <li>Clear an area to roll out the pasta dough. Pour the flour on the area and create a volcano shape. Add the egg mixture to the flour and, using a fork, slowly mix in flour to the egg. Keep mixing in the flour little by little until all the flour is mixed in. Try to do this in a way so the egg does not spill outside the flour walls. You can continue with a bench scraper to mix the ingredients until the consistency is solid enough to begin kneading.</li>
        <li>Before beginning to knead the dough, form it into a ball to start. To knead you first want to take your palm and roll it over the dough, adding pressure to flatten the dough a bit. The dough will have an oval shape now. Take your palm and roll it back to fold the long edge of the dough back into itself. Rotate the dough slightly and repeat. Knead the dough for about 8 minutes, or more if needed. You cant over knead the dough.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough in a ball and sprinkle with flour. Wrap in plastic and let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. This will relax the gluton and prevent the dough from shrinking when rolling the dough.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 4 and make your favorite pasta!</li>
        <li>When cooking your pasta, remember to salt the water generously! Fresh pasta does not take long to cook, 1-2 minutes at the most. Dried pasta takes longer to cook and has more time to absorb salt while cooking, but fresh pasta requires more salt because of the lesser cook time.</li>
